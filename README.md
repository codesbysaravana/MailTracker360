Our Project (Made with Next.js)
This project is like a starter kit for building websites. We used a special tool called create-next-app to get it going quickly.

🚀 How to Get Started (On Your Computer)
Think of this as turning on your website on your own computer so you can work on it.

Open your Terminal/Command Prompt (this is the text-based window where you type commands).

Type one of these commands and press Enter:

npm run dev  # (This is usually the easiest way)
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Open Your Web Browser: After running the command, open your internet browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and type this address:

http://localhost:3000

You should now see your website running right there on your computer!

Start Making Changes:

To change what you see on the main page of your website, open the file named app/page.tsx in your code editor.
As you make changes to this file and save them, your website in the browser will automatically update – no need to restart!
This project also uses a special feature (next/font) to make sure all the text on your website looks really good and loads super fast.

🌐 How to Put Your Website Online (Easily)
The simplest way to share your website with the world is to use a service called Vercel. It's made by the same people who made Next.js, so it works perfectly.
